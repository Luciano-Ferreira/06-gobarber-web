## :rocket: Technologies used

- Hooks from reactJS:
- useContext: to pass values deep into the component tree without explicitly passing it through each component;
- useEffect: to perform side effects on functional components;
- useState: useState is a Hook that allows you to add the React state to a function component;
- in addition to these hooks we created a new hook to handle the useAuth styling react-icons.
- JWT: jwt was used to control the user's session time so that he is not logged in forever.
- axios: axios was used to connect to the back-end api.
- YUP: yup was used to validate user data.
